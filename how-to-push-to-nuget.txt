to publish, run the following commands in the library directory:
    
    dotnet clean
    dotnet pack -c release
    dotnet nuget push -s https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json .\bin\Release\<package>.<version>.nupkg 

 You must also have configured your nuget api-key, e.g. via  NuGet.exe setApiKey <your-api-key-here>.  The api key is saved in your profile, so you need to do that only once.
